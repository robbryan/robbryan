<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>

<p>Welcome to my GitHub Page. This is my personal GitHub account, where I occasionally spend some 
  of my spare time tinkering with a few technologies that I'm keen to learn more about. I'm a 
  programmer who enjoys living and working in sunny Adelaide, South Australia. Virtually nothing 
  in my GitHub account currently relates to my day-job, but some of the ideas in my PowerShell 
  Toolbox are inspired by and expanded upon in my regular work.</p>

<p>I tend to think of myself as an IT carpenter:, where software is my material of choice. 
  I generally prefer to build small things for myself, like the software equivalent of "cabinetry" 
  rather than "sky-scrapers". One of the joys of being a programmer is that there's always something 
  new to learn, whether it be a new technology, or a new paradigm. I'm constantly surprised at how 
  easy it is in this industry to suddenly be left behind!</p>
<p>I view myself as being pragmatic and an "agnostic" when it comes to technology. I don't mind what
  technology mix I need to use, but when given a choice professionally I tend to prefer a Microsoft-based 
  technology stack over other offerings, and the new-look Microsoft just makes that easier these days.</p>

<a id="the-new-microsoft" class="anchor" href="#the-new-microsoft" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The New Microsoft</h3>

<p>I've always used Microsoft tools and languages professionally, but their attitude towards open source 
  never sat well with me. This has all changed with the new Microsoft (or is that the new-new Microsoft?), 
  which appears to be a dramatically different company. It's great to see them creating and supporting 
  open source software, and even open sourcing their core technology like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell">PowerShell</a>.</p>
<p>If twenty years ago someone told me the one day Microsoft would join the Linux Foundation as a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/members/corporate">Platinum Member</a>, 
  I would've told them to stay off the drugs!</p>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/robbryan/powershell-toolbox">PowerShell Toolbox</a> is a personal 
repository consisting of a number of useful (to me) scripts, and code snippets developed while 
learning more about PowerShell.</p>
